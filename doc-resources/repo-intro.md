This Fortify SSC parser plugin allows for importing [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) SBOM files into SSC. Two versions of this plugin are available:

* `fortify-ssc-parser-generic-cyclonedx.jar`
	 * Parser plugin compatible with all recent SSC versions
	 * CycloneDX issues are displayed on the SSC Audit page only
* `fortify-ssc-22.2+-parser-generic-cyclonedx.jar`
	 * Parser plugin compatible with SSC 22.2 and above
	 * CycloneDX issues are displayed on both SSC Audit page and SSC Open Source page
	 
Given the limitations listed below, please check whether there is any more appropriate / product-specific parser plugin available before using this generic plugin. For example, although this generic parser plugin is able to import results in CycloneDX format generated by [Debricked](https://debricked.com/), it is better to use the [Debricked-specific parser plugin](https://github.com/fortify/fortify-ssc-parser-debricked-cyclonedx).
	 
### Limitations

* **Actual results may vary depending on input**  
  For example, due to the flexibility of the CycloneDX specification:  
    * Some CycloneDX input files may not include vulnerability data, which may result in failing or empty import
    * The plugin may be unable to calculate consistent, unique issue instance id's because the input file doesn't provide sufficient details to uniquely identify an issue
    * The plugin may not be able to determine Fortify Priority Order because the input file does not provide issue severity levels
    * The plugin may be unable to display appropriate issue category or description because the input file is lacking this information, or providing this information in a non-standard way 

* **CycloneDX results from multiple tools cannot be uploaded to single SSC application version**  
  Being a generic format, you may have multiple tools generating CycloneDX files that you want to import into SSC. Due to limitations in the SSC parser framework, it is currently not possible to import CycloneDX files from different sources into a single SSC application version. Independent of which tool was actually used to generate the CycloneDX file, SSC will assume that all CycloneDX files originate from the same scan engine. SSC will try to merge these uploads, thereby basically marking all issues from a previously uploaded CycloneDX file as 'removed'.
